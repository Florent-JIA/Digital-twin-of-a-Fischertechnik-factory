In the storage part we found 36 wires which are gathered in a bundle. 
Typically there would be 36 pins on the PLC that can be connected to these 36 wires. 
But indeed there are twenty pins on the PLC. So we think that some wires are useless. 
In addition, these 36 wires must correspond to 36 pins on the adapter board of the storage module. 
On this card, we found 8 places which are used to install the PLC connection terminals. 
There are 4 holes in each place to install the terminals. A place between them is empty. 
The other 7 places are occupied by the terminals. In addition, we found 4 PLWM. 
The PLWM1 and PLWM2 are put together, the PLWM3 and the PLWM4 too. 
As we said above, there would be 36 pins on the board to connect the wires. 
So we think that these 36 pins consist of the 32 holes of the 8 places for the terminals and the 2 groups of PLWM. 
However 4 PLWMs should have corresponded to 4 sons even if they are grouped.
