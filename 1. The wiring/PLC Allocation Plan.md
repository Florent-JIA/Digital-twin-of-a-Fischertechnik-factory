# PLC Allocation Plan
The PLC Allocation Plan is available [here](https://github.com/Weizhe-JIA/2.Digital-twin-of-a-Fischertechnik-factory/blob/main/1.%20The%20wiring/Lernfabrik4.0_24V_Belegungsplan-EN.pdf).

It's split in four sections. Each section explains some part of the connection interfaces available in the factory:
- [Description of the adapter board](https://github.com/Weizhe-JIA/2.Digital-twin-of-a-Fischertechnik-factory/blob/main/1.%20The%20wiring/Description%20of%20the%20adapter%20board.md)
- [Description of the PLC ribbon cable terminals]()
- (for each [module]()) Assignment table between PLC terminal and factory module functions
- (for each [module]()) Description of the module wiring through color coded ribbon cables
