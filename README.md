# Digital twin of a Fishertechnik factory
This is a complex project organized by the school. My teammates and I built a digital twin for our Fischertechnik factory model over 6 months. In order to realize it, we have accomplished the wiring of the factory model, wrote the control program to make the factory run, built a dashboard to display the working status of each module of the factory, established a real-time 3D representation of the factory and wrote script codes to automate the program execution
