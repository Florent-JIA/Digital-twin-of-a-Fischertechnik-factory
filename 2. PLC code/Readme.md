# PLC code of the SLD module
In this file, I will describe our work for the coding of the SLD module (and its correct functioning).

First of all, we had to list the different actions that we wanted our code to make :

- detect a new element at the entrance of the SLD module
- activate the conveyer belt
- detect the color of the element
- activate the correct ejector at the right time to make the element fall into its compartment

In order to fully understand the functioning of the SLD module we made a plan of it :

Note : In order to have a landmark on the conveyer belt (to know where we are with an element), we do not use a clock. Indeed, if the motor had an issue we would not be able to correctly sort the element. That's why we use the pulse input, the pulse allows us to measure the distance the conveyer belt runs through the simulation (it turns and changes state when a certain distance is generated by the motor).

Now that we see what we are talking about and that we know what we want to do, we need to make a state graph with the different inputs and outputs involved in each part of the SLD module :

We are now able to code the different parts / states of the SLD module and make them communicate. Our code for the functioning of the SLD module is available here : [Fonctionnement_SLD.ino](/)

Note : There is no need to define the pinmodes in comparison to many other Arduino projects since the IndustrialShield board understands which pin we are calling by itself. Moreover, you can either call a pin by its number ("66") or by its name ("I2.7").

Note : You need to let a delay between the activation / desactivation of the compressor and its last action. Else the valves of the ejectors might make strange things ðŸ˜„  .

Note : Do not forget to comment your code a lot so that the next team won't be lost (we did our best but you might need to add some comments if you fell so).

Note : The code we realised can only handle one element at a time. It is possible to make it able to handle several elements using lists and queues, however it implies great changes in Arduino, in Unity and in Node-red and we realised that quite late which is why we only cared about one element.

Note : Our code has been designed so that it can be integrated with other modules of the factory. Indeed, in the "Loop" method, we call the "sld" method which makes the SLD module works, you are then able to add other methods called by your modules'names so that the "Loop" method remains understandable.
